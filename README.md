# Pygame-Snake-Game

Basic snake game in python with GUI. This project took way longer than I 
would like to admit, but in the end I got it finished.
This implemention is just a tad bit more realistic where instead of an apple
being eaten its a mouse and by mouse I mean a grey rectangle. Also the snake can 
Double over and run into itself because thats what happens in real life.

in the resources/ folder there is a grid render() you might want to use, but i doubt
anyone will ever see this.

# PS
also you can steal this code its not a big deal.
